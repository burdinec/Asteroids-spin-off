# Asteroids-spin-off
A game I have been working on that has the same core idea as the old-time classic, asteroids. However, in this version the ship remains at the bottom of the screen, and the only user movements are horizontal left and right to avoid the approaching asteroids. I am yet to add the implementation for shooting at the asteroids, and I would like to add a running score count that increases with time and when the user destroys asteroids.


Recently the game has stopped working and I am unsure why. I am working on a macbook and I believe the issue is related to my program having access to keyboard inputs from my laptop. If anyone has had experience with this type of issue any advice is greatly apprecaited!

At its current state
